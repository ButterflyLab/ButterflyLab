\opening{Dear members of the Editorial Board:}

I would like to submit the manuscript entitled
``Fast Algorithms for the Multi-dimensional Jacobi Polynomial Transform''
by James Bremer, Qiyuan Pang, and myself to Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis.


We use the well-known observation that the solutions of Jacobi's differential 
equation can be represented via non-oscillatory phase and amplitude functions to develop 
 a fast algorithm for computing multi-dimensional Jacobi polynomial transforms.
More explicitly,  it  follows from this observation that the matrix corresponding to the 
discrete Jacobi transform is the Hadamard product of a 
numerically low-rank matrix and a multi-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix.
The application of the Hadamard product can 
be carried out via $O(1)$ fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), resulting in a nearly optimal algorithm to compute the multidimensional Jacobi polynomial transform. 

Thank you very much for your attention and please let me know if
there is anything else I can help with.

\closing{With best regards,}
