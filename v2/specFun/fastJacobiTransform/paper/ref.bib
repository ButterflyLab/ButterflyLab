Our approach, which applies in the case in which both of the parameters \\$\\alpha \\$ and \\$\\beta \\$ in Jacobi’s differential equation are of magnitude less than \\$1/2\\$, is based on the well-known fact that in this regime Jacobi’s differential equation admits a nonoscillatory phase function that can be loosely approximated via an affine function over much of its domain. We illustrate this with several numerical experiments, the source code for which is publicly available.}",

In essence, the algorithm consists of an integration of a suitably weighted function along an ellipse, a task which can be accomplished with Fast {F}ourier Transform, followed by some post-processing. The mathematical underpinning of this algorithm is an old formula that expresses expansion coefficients {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}hat{\{}f{\}}{\_}m{\}}{\$}{\$}as infinite linear combinations of derivatives. We evaluate the latter with the Cauchy theorem, thereby expressing each {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}hat{\{}f{\}}{\_}m{\}}{\$}{\$}as a scaled integral of {\$}{\$}{\{}f(z){\backslash}varphi{\_}m(z)/z^{\{}m+1{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}along an appropriate contour, where {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}varphi{\_}m{\}}{\$}{\$}is a slowly converging hypergeometric function. Next, we transform {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}varphi{\_}m{\}}{\$}{\$}into another hypergeometric function which converges rapidly. Once we replace the latter function by its truncated Taylor expansion and choose an appropriate elliptic contour, we obtain an expression for the {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}hat{\{}f{\}}{\_}m{\}}{\$}{\$}s which is amenable to rapid computation.",

title="Spectral Methods: Fundamentals in Single Domains",

publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="3--37",
abstract="Spectral methods are a class of spatial discretizations for differential equations. The key components for their formulation are the trial functions (also called the expansion or approximating functions) and the test functions (also known as weight functions). The trial functions, which are linear combinations of suitable trial basis functions, are used to provide the approximate representation of the solution. The test functions are used to ensure that the differential equation and perhaps some boundary conditions are satisfied as closely as possible by the truncated series expansion. This is achieved by minimizing, with respect to a suitable norm, the residual produced by using the truncated expansion instead of the exact solution. The residual accounts for the differential equation and sometimes the boundary conditions, either explicitly or implicitly. For this reason they may be viewed as a special case of the method of weighted residuals (Finlayson and Scriven (1966)). An equivalent requirement is that the residual satisfy a suitable orthogonality condition with respect to each of the test functions. From this perspective, spectral methods may be viewed as a special case of Petrov-Galerkin methods (Zienkiewicz and Cheung (1967), Babu{\v{s}}ka and Aziz (1972)).",

We establish their basic approximation properties in suitably weighted Sobolev spaces. As an example of their applications, we show that the generalized Jacobi polynomials/functions, with indexes corresponding to the number of homogeneous boundary conditions in a given partial differential equation, are the natural basis functions for the spectral approximation of this partial differential equation. Moreover, the use of generalized Jacobi polynomials/functions leads to much simplified analysis, more precise error estimates and well conditioned algorithms."
