function h = g2h(g, epsilon)

% G = h2g(H,EPSILON)
%
% Hybrid-G to Hybrid-H transformation
% G and H are matrices of size [2,2,F]
% where F is the number of frequencies
% (the number of ports is always 2)
% 
% EPSILON is a limit used in finding correspondent Hybrid-H matrices 
% in the vicinity of singularities; 
% by default set to 1e-12, should provide accurate results
% realistic problems; could be increased for a gain in speed

%               - now this is just a wrapper function for h2g
%                 (actually a protected inverse)
