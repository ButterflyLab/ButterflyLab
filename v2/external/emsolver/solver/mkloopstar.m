% Makes IL and IS matrices which transform RWG basis functions to loops and
% stars. The matrices are defined as:
%    IL*Il + IS*Is = I, [L] = IL'*[f], [S] = IS'*[f]
% where Il and Is are the loops and stars basis function coefficients
% correspondingly, [f] is conventional RWG basis, [L] is the loop basis
% and [S] is the star basis. The matrix dimensions are IL(NxNL) and IS(NxNS),
% NL is number of loops and NS is number of stars.
% There is an exapmle how EFIE for PEC looks like when using loop-star basis:
% T = [ IL IS ]     - transform matrix
% Z*I=V
%   Zls = Tt*Z*T  (Z = <<G,f_n>,f_m>, f_n - expansion, f_m - testing)
%   I = T*Ils     (I is the coefficients vector of basis f_n)
%   Vls = Tt*V    (V = <Einc,f_m>, excitation)

% for the whole mesh, separately for each of the shapes.
