% f_cross_grad calculation begins here.
%
% f_cross_grad = f X grad(exp(-j*k*R)/R), where f is the RWG basis function
%  given by f = r - r(l), and r is the evaluation point coordinates and
%  r(l) is the free vertex.
%
% First, we compute the tangential (to the plane of triangle) part. Similar
% to the integrals above, we divide it into two parts:
%   x1 = r X grad(exp(-j*k*R)/R)
%   x2 = r(l) X grad(exp(-j*k*R)/R)
% The first part includes the observation coordinate only, while the second
% depends on the free vertex position as well.
%
% First part - depends on the observation coordinate only. The tangential
% part of the target function can be written as:
%   fxg_t_x = y*d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
%   fxg_t_y = -x*d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
% Derivatives of z*exp(-j*k*R)/R by x and y can be seen to be equal to:
%   d(z*exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dx = x*d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
%   d(z*exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dy = y*d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
% Vector cross product of this with the triangle normal gives the target
% funtion, so we need to integrate the z*exp(-j*k*R)/R along the triangle
% edges to obtain the target surface integral vaule (see aforementioned
% papers on Gordon Bilow transform for additional details)
integrand3 = exp(-j*k*qR)./qR;
integral3 = -h_r.*sum(integrand3.*qW_3,3).*(s/2);
fxg_obs = sum(nu.*repmat(integral3, [ 1 1 3 ]),1);
% Transform (x*dgdz,y*dgdz) into (y*dgdz,-x*dgdz)
fxg_obs = cross(fxg_obs, n, 3);

% Find indices of the elements for which h=0. Used later to zero the
% corresponding f_cross_grad elements.
%h_zeros = find(abs_h < 1e-15);

% Second part - includes the free vertex position. Can be written as:
%   fxg_t_x = y(l)*d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
%   fxg_t_y = -x(l)*d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
% where x(l) and y(l) are coordinates of the free vertex. These are
% constants and can be taken out of the integral. Thus, we only need to
% calculate integral of:
%   f = d(exp(-j*k*R)/R)/dz
% over the triangle. Consider the vector function with the following
% components:
%   f_x = x*z*exp(-j*k*R)/(R*(x^2+y^2))
%   f_y = y*z*exp(-j*k*R)/(R*(x^2+y^2))
% Its divergence is equal to the target function given above, thus,
% according to the divergence theorem we can integrate this vector
% function over the triangle edges instead of evaluating the surface
% integral.
integrand4a = -exp(-j*k*qR)./(q_rho_2.*qR);
% The f_x and f_y given above is singular when rho=0 (and thus
% integrand4a is); to address that we add the following correction terms:
%   g_x = -x*z*exp(-j*k*abs(h))/(abs(h)*(x^2+y^2))
%   g_y = -y*z*exp(-j*k*abs(h))/(abs(h)*(x^2+y^2))
% so:
%   f_x_nonsing = f_x + g_x
%   f_y_nonsing = f_y + g_y
% Now it can be seen that both f_x_nonsing and f_y_nonsing are non-singular
% i.e. they converge to a finite limit when rho -> 0.
% This does not affect the integration results because divergence of vector
% function (g_x, g_y) is zero.
