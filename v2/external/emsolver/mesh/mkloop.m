% [tri, x, y, z] = mkloop(r, rc, n, nc, nr, ga)
%
% Makes a loop with with circular cross section. The difference between a loop
% and a ring is that loop has a gap. The resulting loop is lying in xz plane,
% x axis lies in the center of the gap, x=-r is the gap center. The resulting
% triangles are oriented CCW when looking from outside, so the normal
% oriented according to the right-hand rule is pointing outwards.
%  r   - radius of the loop
%  rc  - radius of the cross section
%  n   - number of panels along the loop. Each panel consists of two
%        triangles.
%  nc  - number of panels around the cross section.
%  nr  - number of edges along the radius in the discs at the ends of
%        the loop.
%  ga  - opening angle of the gap
