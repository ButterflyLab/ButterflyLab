%
% Makes a loop with square cross section. The difference between a loop
% and a ring is that loop has a gap. The resulting loop is lying in xz plane,
% x axis lies in the center of the gap, x=-r is the gap center. The resulting
% triangles are oriented CCW when looking from outside, so the normal
% oriented according to the right-hand rule is pointing outwards.
%  r   - radius of the loop
%  lc  - crossection edge length
%  n   - number of panels along the loop. Each panel consists of two
%        triangles.
%  nc  - total number of panels along the crossection. Therefore the number
%        of panels along one edge is nc/4, nc should contain 4.
%  ga  - opening angle of the gap

if (rem(nc,4) ~= 0)
  error ('mkloop: nc should contain 4.');
